'''
this is a very basic decryptor for melicius moth program
it works very slowly and dosen't really crack it in a time that is ressonable
probbaly would take ou life time to get correst as the possablity of it getting it is infinite

and it will only go so far to give you the binary code that the malware generates nothing more as it is impossable 
unless you brute force the code to get the numbers then try decrypt it from that (not possble in a life time)
